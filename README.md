# Dice Chess bot — Python starter

A complete, **runnable** Dice Chess bot in dependency-free Python. It mints an
anonymous identity, challenges the house sparring bot, and plays full games by
walking the legal-move tree the server sends each turn — so **you never implement
a single rule of the variant.**

MIT-licensed: copy it into a closed-source bot with no strings attached. Playing
over the wire imposes no obligation, and this starter links no engine — see
[Licensing for Bots](https://rabestro.github.io/dicechess-play-api/licensing/).

## Quickstart

[**Use this template**](https://github.com/rabestro/dicechess-bot-python/generate) → clone your copy → run:

```bash
python bot.py
```

That's it. No dependencies, no signup — it mints an anonymous token and starts
playing `house/greedy` immediately. You'll see moves land in the log:

```
INFO minted anonymous identity bot:team:anon:python-starter-…
INFO game c0f0…: played e2e3 d1f3 b1c3 (v11)
```

Requires Python 3.9+.

## Make it yours

The only decision the bot makes is in **`choose_move`** (`bot.py`) — the baseline
walks a random root-to-leaf path of the legal-move tree. Replace it with your
strategy; everything else (auth, discovery, the activity loop, retries) is
transport you can leave alone.

```python
def choose_move(legal_moves: dict) -> list[str]:
    # legal_moves is a prefix tree of UCI micro-moves; a leaf ({}) is a full turn.
    # Return the path you want to play, or [] for a forced pass.
    ...
```

## Going further

- **A durable identity** (survives restarts, joins the rating ladder): set
  `DICECHESS_TOKEN` to a registered token instead of minting anonymously. See
  [Authentication & Identity](https://rabestro.github.io/dicechess-play-api/authentication/).
- **Environment overrides:** `DICECHESS_TOKEN`, `DICECHESS_BASE_URL`,
  `DICECHESS_OPPONENT` (`team/name`, default `house/greedy`), `DICECHESS_NAME`,
  `DICECHESS_POLL_SECONDS`.
- **The full API:** <https://rabestro.github.io/dicechess-play-api/> — REST reference,
  event streams, webhooks, and the provably-fair dice verification procedure.

## What's inside

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `bot.py` | The runnable poll-only bot and its `choose_move` — **edit this**. |
| `dicechess/client.py` | Thin transport client: auth, REST calls, retry/backoff, `Retry-After`, 401 re-mint. |

## Connection modes

This starter uses **polling** — the simplest mode, ideal for a cron/serverless
function. For low-latency play use the ndjson **event streams**, or for pure
serverless register a **webhook** (the server POSTs your turns). Both are
documented under [Connection Modes](https://rabestro.github.io/dicechess-play-api/connection-modes/).
